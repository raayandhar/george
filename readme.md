I wasn't sure if this is exactly what the assignment wanted, but I referenced the example notebooks
and the SpuCo documentation and used the API there instead of doing things through torch.

I might have missed something but I also did not see how to partition classes and what spurious correlation
strength to use, so I just used what I saw in the example notebooks. Happy to redo it if I did not
understand the objective.
